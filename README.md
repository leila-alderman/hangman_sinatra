# Hipster Hangman

Welcome to Hipster Hangman! You've probably never heard of it.

This project was built using Sinatra, Ruby, HTML, and CSS. The hipster icons disappear one by one as you guess incorrect letters. If you guess the word correctly, you're sure to impress all those other losers.

[This project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sinatra-project?ref=lnav) is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.
