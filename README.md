# Caesar Cipher

This Sinatra app accepts a text input and a shift integer, and it outputs the resulting text after applying the Caesar cipher.

A [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is one of the oldest and most widely known encryption techniques. It's a type of substitution cipher in which each letter is replaced by a different letter a set number of positions away in the alphabet. [For example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36xNpbosfTY), with a right shift of 3, "D" becomes "G", and "L" becomes "O".
